## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```go
import (
    "github.com/didip/distobject-go/distobject"
)

type User struct {
    Name  string `redis:"name"`
    Email string `redis:"email"`
}

func main() {
    r := distobject.NewRedisClient("localhost:6379")
    user := &User{Name: "Alice", Email: "alice@example.com"}

    d := distobject.NewDistObject(r, "user", "user-updates")
    _ = d.Save(user)

    // Later load
    loaded := &User{}
    d2 := distobject.NewDistObject(r, "user", "user-updates")
    _ = d2.Load(d.ID(), loaded)

    fmt.Println(loaded.Name)  // Alice
}
```

## Running Tests Locally
